Angular Cellar

This is AngularJS version of Node Celler (https://github.com/ccoenraets/nodecellar, 
http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/nodecellar-sample-application-with-backbone-js-twitter-bootstrap-node-js-express-and-mongodb/, 
http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/creating-a-rest-api-using-node-js-express-and-mongodb/). It's basically a rip-off of the great Node.js example, however, I sort of recreated this using AngularJS since the example was using Backbone.js and I wanted to use AngularJS. 
If there's an issue with it (from a copyright perspective), I would take it down. You can reach me at satoshiinoue.biz@gmail.com.

Yet this is my first attempt using AngularJS, so hopefully I can shape it even better.
